- intro the Mousterian debate
    * [set the stage for various deconstructions to follow, of media theory's use of technogenesis, of media archaeology itself, etc.]
    * Wolfgang Ernst used as pivot point, the "magic" of objects
    * this debate dramatizes what it is to think *through* technology?
        + not just thinking about technology but thinking through technology
        + technology's ontological magic
        + [introduce this as an intervention into media archaeology earlier??]
- what is media archaeology?
- why prehistorical (and classical?) archaeology are relevant
    * [more about archaeology as a field relevant for media archaeology]

Notes

Shoot for 6-8k words.
 
Something more than just a lit review.  Perhaps a mix between an intellectual history and a case study?

Conceptualizing the encounter between a user and a tool.  Heidegger is useful here, but what we're after is something like *interaction* and future-directedness.

Heidegger's object vs. *Thing*
-------------------------------

Point to remember here is simply that, outside practitioners of media archaeology, the observation that objects are in motion, never concrete, always changing, is not novel.  It goes back to Heidegger, and more recently Latour.

Latour, "Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"  "…all his writing aims to make as sharp a distinction as possible between, on the one hand, objects, *Gegenstand,* and, on the other, the celebrated *Thing.*  The handmade jug can be a thing, while the industrially made can of Coke remains an object.  While the latter is abandoned to the empty mastery of science and technology, only the former, cradled in the respectful idiom of art, craftsmanship, and poetry, could deploy and gather its rich set of connections." (@latour_why_2004, p. 233)

"And, yet, Heidegger, when he takes the jug seriously, offers a powerful vocabulary to talk about the object he despises so much.  What would happen, I wonder, if we tried to talk about the object of science and technology, the *Gegenstand*, as if it had the rich and complicated qualities of the celebrated *Thing*? (ibid)

i.e., why can't the Challenger be treated like a Thing, an assemblage of material and nonmaterial forces and assumptions

"If a thing is a gathering, as Heidegger says…"

"If the 'thinging of the thing' is a gathering that always connects the "united four, earth and sky, divinities and mortals, in the simple onefold of their self-unified fourfold'"… (235)

1.
--

In order to track down the poetics of imagining and imaginary solutions, I would like to proceed inductively, taking my cue from the evolution of a particularly appropriate genre of technology: the gadget.

2. taking the proposition literally that gadgets are causing us to evolve
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do think we should take this proposition -- that gadgets are causing us to evolve -- at its word.  But it's a proposition that makes sense not because digital media have come down from on high in order to alter the nature of human cognition.  Instead, I want to emphasize how a deeper history of gadgetry -- a category that has encompassed tools, techniques, and ideas -- provides a means to register shifts in the evolving ways we think with technology.  The versatile gadget ("What an odd little word 'gadget' is, almost a gadget in itself, so small and useful," writes Vita Sackville-West[18]) has been applied throughout the twentieth century not only to specific tools, but to modes of manufacture, forms of expertise, imaginary machines, styles of problem solving, and fictional devices.  While gadget might refer to a concrete object you can hold in your hand, the word might just as easily refer to any tool that has been forgotten, rigged up on the fly, or not yet invented.  The gadget lives a curiously double life, alternating between the functional and the fictional.  To speak then of the history of gadgetry is not merely to turn our attention the small, seemingly trivial objects that the more distinguished lineages of material culture studies and the history of technology have systematically passed over; it is to isolate those imaginary dimensions that evolutionary trees and archaeological layers cannot convey.

What makes the gadget an important and understudied topic in the cultural history of technological media is the fact that its fundamental instrumentality changes from decade to decade.  Originating among sailors in the 1850s as a placeholder for the name of any object that had slipped from memory, the application of the term gradually shifts to individual cogs within the complex machinery of steam ships, rather than the simple rope, pulley, or implement.  Over the next few decades, the word could refer to specific devices (as the proper name for a wire tying cotton baler, sparking interstate commerce debates in 1905 over the density versus the weight of rail cargo), categories of devices (as accessories added on to automobiles in the 1900s, airplanes and guns in the 1910s, and gramophones and cameras in the 1920s), and characteristics of devices (signifying in the 1930s something cobbled together from preexisting materials).  By the end of the 30s, it became possible to speak of the gadget as a mode of thought ("I have found Americans out. They are gadget-minded. ... They have created a touch-the-button civilization")[19] or a kind of phrase ("The machinery of propaganda is made of standardized gadgets by which you can detect it. One of these gadgets is slogans"[20]).  From halyards to pistons to can-openers to pagers, the wager of Gadgetry: New Media and the Fictional Imagination is that by holding all of these diverse instances together as a set, we will be able to track an evolution in the imaginative space between tools and their users.
