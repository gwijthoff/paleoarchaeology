game plan
--------------

lead with: archaeology is a useful term, but we use it too quickly.  the kind of hand wavy gesture made when wires are connected to ideology and power and discourse.  let's get in there and figure out *how* this circuit is made from material to culture

there are two examples i'm getting out of archaeology, the user and the interpreter, the neanderthal and the archaeologist.  make sure to spell these out, because there are two separate stories to tell here
    interpreter:  this is a useful story as we have a moment when people trained in text analysis are learning to analyze objects.  that shift is *the* story in play here.

a final gesture where I wrap up what is essentially a new interpretive tool that I have applied to the Dynabook, a methodological tool that you the reader can pick up and use

misc
------

reader questions and warnings and warnings:

- what does archaeology offer the history of media rather than history of technology?  make that explicit.
    - history of tech and SCOT has nothing to say about the individual user, and the way 
- there's a slippage in terms between technology and medium often, which "gadget" just muddles.  be aware of this
- there's at once too much and too little information.  needs to be smoothed out
- don't construct too much of a straw man when it comes to history of technology -- whiggish, progressivist narratives of technological progress have thoroughly been dealt with in the field.
    - especially Leo Marx, "Technology: A Dangerous Concept"
    - there's also a literature on technological competition and lost technologies -- bluray, mp3, flash (Tarleton Gillespie) etc.

There are cultural anthropologists who have been doing similar work, such as Danny Miller.  Why use paleoarchaeology, for instance, and not cultural anthropologists?

In effect, a similar move to ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny -- the individual syntax and decisions of the user recapitulate shifts in the "history" and morphology of a given tool

examples of a tech being used to different ends?  Ed Russell, War on Nature, and "war-born" chemicals like napalm used in domestic sphere?

    * Wolfgang Ernst used as pivot point, the "magic" of objects
    * this debate dramatizes what it is to think *through* technology?
        + not just thinking about technology but thinking through technology
        + technology's ontological magic
        + [introduce this as an intervention into media archaeology earlier??]
- what is media archaeology?
- why prehistorical (ie. paleo-) (and classical?) archaeology are relevant

Are Gadgets Making Us Stupid?
------------------------------

- popular conversation on cognitive impact of mobile media
- technogenesis introduction
- can an individual feel the pressure of evolutionary change within a lifetime?

Epistemological Reverse Engineering
------------------------------------

- Paleoarchaeology's "epistemological reverse engineering" (Ernst) of human tool use mirrors the very process it seeks to uncover:  we hold a tool and attempt to think through the contours of what it affords.
 
Notes
======

Shoot for 6-8k words.
 
Something more than just a lit review.  Perhaps a mix between an intellectual history and a case study?  What's a specific object or case study that could be used?  Perhaps Alan Kay's speculative design for a tablet for children?  How that invokes imaginary media *as well as* concerns about cognitive abilities, learning challenges, growing/learning through tools, etc?  An archaeology of the "tablet," something that has a ton of "paleo-" resonance, tablet as a writing surface, etc.  Or is that too convenient, too cutesy?  A geographical map of spread of stone tool modes could be related to conceptual spread of ideas of reading/learning/literacy?

Conceptualizing the encounter between a user and a tool.  Heidegger is useful here, but what we're after is something like *interaction* and future-directedness.

Quote to use somewhere:  "Though there exists one major academic industry … telling the social scientists … how they can turn themselves into genuine scientists, there exists another, with at least as flourishing an output, putatively establishing that the study of man and society cannot be scientific." Ernest Gellner, *Relativism and the Social Sciences,* p. 120 qtd. in @trigger_history_2006.

Heidegger's object vs. *Thing*
-------------------------------

Point to remember here is simply that, outside practitioners of media archaeology, the observation that objects are in motion, never concrete, always changing, is not novel.  It goes back to Heidegger, and more recently Latour.

Latour, "Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"  "…all his writing aims to make as sharp a distinction as possible between, on the one hand, objects, *Gegenstand,* and, on the other, the celebrated *Thing.*  The handmade jug can be a thing, while the industrially made can of Coke remains an object.  While the latter is abandoned to the empty mastery of science and technology, only the former, cradled in the respectful idiom of art, craftsmanship, and poetry, could deploy and gather its rich set of connections." (@latour_why_2004, p. 233)

"And, yet, Heidegger, when he takes the jug seriously, offers a powerful vocabulary to talk about the object he despises so much.  What would happen, I wonder, if we tried to talk about the object of science and technology, the *Gegenstand*, as if it had the rich and complicated qualities of the celebrated *Thing*? (ibid)

i.e., why can't the Challenger be treated like a Thing, an assemblage of material and nonmaterial forces and assumptions

"If a thing is a gathering, as Heidegger says…"

"If the 'thinging of the thing' is a gathering that always connects the "united four, earth and sky, divinities and mortals, in the simple onefold of their self-unified fourfold'"… (235)

In order to track down the poetics of imagining and imaginary solutions, I would like to proceed inductively, taking my cue from the evolution of a particularly appropriate genre of technology: the gadget.

2. "new" media
---------------

(It is for this reason that the "new media" in this study's subtitle refers not to digital media, a usage fashionable throughout the 2000s that has since tapered off, but to the ways in which media are "always already new," in the words of Lisa Gitelman:  those moments that new devices and forms of communication have historically opened up a space of unfamiliarity, shock, or disruption, a void that, as we will see, speculations and imaginaries quickly rush in to fill.[33])

[33] Lisa Gitelman, Always Already New: Media History and the Data of Culture (MIT Press, 2006).  Janet Murray writes critiques "...the vagueness of the term [new media] encourages sloppy thinking about design by suggesting that novelty is the salient property of these phenomena.  Video games and word processors have been around since the 1970s, but they pose design problems that are also found in the most cutting-edge robotics or virtual reality installation.  Calling objects made with computing technology 'new' media obscures the fact that it is the computer that is defining difference not the novelty.  After all, a newspaper printed on a cereal box would be a new medium if it were to appear tomorrow, but no one would refer to it as a 'new media' because it is not computer based."  Inventing the Medium, 8.  See also Wendy Chun and Thomas Keenan's introduction New Media, Old Media (Routledge, 2006) for a discussion of this phrase's provenance.

3. taking the proposition literally that gadgets are causing us to evolve
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do think we should take this proposition -- that gadgets are causing us to evolve -- at its word.  But it's a proposition that makes sense not because digital media have come down from on high in order to alter the nature of human cognition.  Instead, I want to emphasize how a deeper history of gadgetry -- a category that has encompassed tools, techniques, and ideas -- provides a means to register shifts in the evolving ways we think with technology.  The versatile gadget ("What an odd little word 'gadget' is, almost a gadget in itself, so small and useful," writes Vita Sackville-West[18]) has been applied throughout the twentieth century not only to specific tools, but to modes of manufacture, forms of expertise, imaginary machines, styles of problem solving, and fictional devices.  While gadget might refer to a concrete object you can hold in your hand, the word might just as easily refer to any tool that has been forgotten, rigged up on the fly, or not yet invented.  The gadget lives a curiously double life, alternating between the functional and the fictional.  To speak then of the history of gadgetry is not merely to turn our attention the small, seemingly trivial objects that the more distinguished lineages of material culture studies and the history of technology have systematically passed over; it is to isolate those imaginary dimensions that evolutionary trees and archaeological layers cannot convey.

What makes the gadget an important and understudied topic in the cultural history of technological media is the fact that its fundamental instrumentality changes from decade to decade.  Originating among sailors in the 1850s as a placeholder for the name of any object that had slipped from memory, the application of the term gradually shifts to individual cogs within the complex machinery of steam ships, rather than the simple rope, pulley, or implement.  Over the next few decades, the word could refer to specific devices (as the proper name for a wire tying cotton baler, sparking interstate commerce debates in 1905 over the density versus the weight of rail cargo), categories of devices (as accessories added on to automobiles in the 1900s, airplanes and guns in the 1910s, and gramophones and cameras in the 1920s), and characteristics of devices (signifying in the 1930s something cobbled together from preexisting materials).  By the end of the 30s, it became possible to speak of the gadget as a mode of thought ("I have found Americans out. They are gadget-minded. ... They have created a touch-the-button civilization")[19] or a kind of phrase ("The machinery of propaganda is made of standardized gadgets by which you can detect it. One of these gadgets is slogans"[20]).  From halyards to pistons to can-openers to pagers, the wager of Gadgetry: New Media and the Fictional Imagination is that by holding all of these diverse instances together as a set, we will be able to track an evolution in the imaginative space between tools and their users.

Janet Murray makes a similar case for the importance of the humanities in building new technologies:  "Unlike other useful books in HCI (human-computer interaction) or interaction design, this book is written from a humanities perspective.  One of the most important characteristics of humanistic inquiry is that it accommodates multiple frameworks of interpretation, a habit of mind that is a good fit for the design process, which never has a single right answer and is strengthened by an expanded palette of possibilities. ... From a humanities perspective, the design of digital objects is a cultural practice like writing a book or making a film. ... To see any artifact (i.e., any human-made object) as part of culture is to understand how it becomes meaningful through the social activities, thoughts, and actions of the pepole who engage with it."
