- quick line on Bordes's (a.k.a. Carsac) SF stories and criticism

Outline
========

 - intro the Mousterian debate
    * Wolfgang Ernst used as pivot point, the "magic" of objects
    * this debate dramatizes what it is to think *through* technology?
        + technology's ontological magic
        + [introduce this as an intervention into media archaeology first??]
 - what is media archaeology?
 - why prehistorical (and classical?) archaeology are relevant
 
Notes
======
 
Something more than just a lit review.  Perhaps a mix between an intellectual history and a case study?

Conceptualizing the encounter between a user and a tool.  Heidegger is useful here, but what we're after is something like *interaction* and future-directedness.

Heidegger's object vs. *Thing*
-------------------------------

Point to remember here is simply that, outside practitioners of media archaeology, the observation that objects are in motion, never concrete, always changing, is not novel.  It goes back to Heidegger, and more recently Latour.

Latour, "Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"  "…all his writing aims to make as sharp a distinction as possible between, on the one hand, objects, *Gegenstand,* and, on the other, the celebrated *Thing.*  The handmade jug can be a thing, while the industrially made can of Coke remains an object.  While the latter is abandoned to the empty mastery of science and technology, only the former, cradled in the respectful idiom of art, craftsmanship, and poetry, could deploy and gather its rich set of connections." (@latour_why_2004, p. 233)

"And, yet, Heidegger, when he takes the jug seriously, offers a powerful vocabulary to talk about the object he despises so much.  What would happen, I wonder, if we tried to talk about the object of science and technology, the *Gegenstand*, as if it had the rich and complicated qualities of the celebrated *Thing*? (ibid)

i.e., why can't the Challenger be treated like a Thing, an assemblage of material and nonmaterial forces and assumptions

"If a thing is a gathering, as Heidegger says…"

"If the 'thinging of the thing' is a gathering that always connects the "united four, earth and sky, divinities and mortals, in the simple onefold of their self-unified fourfold'"… (235)
