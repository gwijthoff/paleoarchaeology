Michael Schiffer, an archaeologist who first established himself as a founder of **"behavioral archaeology"** and opponent of **processualism**, later in his career wrote a cultural history of the portable radio.

Rodney Harrison (@harrison_surface_2011) provides some background on Schiffer's contributions to the field ("Archaeological Context and Systemic Context," 1972; *Behavioral Archaeology,* 1976), in his discussion of the term "assemblage."  He writes, "the first way of understanding the term 'assemblage' is a familiar archaeological one, in which the assemblage is defined as a group of artefacts found in association with each other in a single context.  The formation of an archaeological assemblage is perceived to be the result of both natural and cultural processes."  Schiffer, he continues,

> famously described the taphonomic processes by which a group of things are transformed into an archaeological assemblage by way of cultural ('C-transforms') and natural ('N-transforms') transformations.  He referred to this as the movement from the systemic context (the original set of relationships between human behaviours and material things) to the archaeological context (the archaeological assemblage which is studied by the archaeologist).  'C-transforms' include a range of cultural processes, such as intentional or non-intentional discard, recycling or reuse, while 'N-transforms' include processes such as biological and chemical weathering and decay.  In surface survey, the context is much more complex than in stratified deposits, and in the case of a deflated surface the surface assemblage might contain a mix of artefacts from a number of different time periods.  Such archaeological sites might be understood as palimpsests, the assemblages at the surface of which are mixed and contain traces from a number of different occupations which are jumbled together.  Implicit within an archaeological use of the term is the idea of the assemblage as a contemporary construction, i.e. the assemblage is created as part of an engagement of an archaeologist-s contemporary classificatory gaze with a series of material remains from the past.  It arises out of the relationship between past and present, and between a contemporary external observer and a set of activities carried out by particular people and particular 'things' in the past.
