This isn't to leave Foucault aside entirely.  To the contrary, the (again, metaphorical) excavation of "shady philosophies" the study of which to him could never "attain the form of scientificity" -- "themes that are never crystallized in a rigorous and individual system â€¦ the history of alchemy rather than chemistry, of animal spirits or phrenology rather than physiology, the history of atomistic themes rather than physics" -- all of these beliefs, imaginaries, and incorrect theories will prove indispensable as we go along in a thoroughgoing account of what it is to think through a tool.

stemming from Foucault's archaeology of knowledge and power, the actualization of "the archive", an exploration of the conditions under which a certain statement or thought becomes possible, an excavation of how things are organized in order to produce knowledge.

historical a priori:  "a condition of reality for statements" (@foucault_archaeology_1969, 127).

archive:  "the law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events."

archaeology:  "The never completed, never wholly achieved uncovering of the archive forms the general horizon to which the description of discursive formations, the analysis of positivities, the mapping of the enunciative field belong.  The right of words -- which is not that of the philologists -- authorizes, therefore, the use of the term *archaeology* to describe all these searches.  This term does not imply the search for a beginning; it does not relate analysis to geological excavation.  It designates the general theme of a description that questions the already-said at the level of its existence: of the enunciative function that operates within it, of the discursive formation, and the general archive system to which it belongs.  Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of the archive." (@foucault_archaeology_1969, 131)

The history of ideas, which for Foucault entails "shady philosophies that haunt literature, art, the sciences, law, ethics, and even man's daily life . . . themes that are never crystallized in a rigorous and individual system", none of this could ever "attain the form of scientificity."  "the history of alchemy rather than chemistry, of animal spirits or phrenology rather than physiology, the history of atomistic themes rather than physics" (@foucault_archaeology_1969, 136)  The presence of these "shady" discourses -- beliefs, imaginaries, incorrect theories -- will be useful as we go along in a thoroughgoing account of what it is to think through a tool.
