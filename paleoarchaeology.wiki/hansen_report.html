            <td>This essay stages an encounter between Michel Foucault’s work—especially his final thought concerning biopolitics, security, and population—and contemporary theorization of media’s experiential impact. The essay argues that the opportunity for such an encounter has been obscured largely due to the role played by Gilles Deleuze (in particular by the concept of “control society”) in filtering Foucault’s work for media theory. The essay develops an approach to Foucault’s late work that centers on the population as a vehicle for rethinking individualization beyond substance; such an approach makes it possible to retain certain aspects of the category of the individual that are simply jettisoned in the contemporary embrace of Deleuze’s “dividual.” The essay concludes by exploring how this rethinking of Foucault’s work on individualization facilitates exploration of the impact of twenty-first-century “atmospheric” media on human individuation.</td>

<p>"If today’s media can be distinguished from earlier media on account of their capacity to solicit our engagement beneath the threshold of attention, we can readily discern the challenges this shift poses to media theory. Nothing less is at stake here than the scale at which theory can operate:" (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/1">Hansen 2012:497</a>)</p>
<p>"Alternatively, we could invoke the pseudoHegelian Aufhebung to which Friedrich Kittler submitted Foucault’s archaeology: for Kittler and his fellow German media scientists, Foucault plays the role of steppingstone, setting into place the infrastructure for discourse networks that themselves demand grounding in concrete media systems.6 As was the case with Poster’s analysis of databases, the Foucault at issue in this media convergence is resolutely the Foucault of the 1970s. We might then ask why we haven’t seen a second round of engagement on the part of media theorists with Foucault’s later work, particularly given the affinity I begin here by citing." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/2">Hansen 2012:498</a>)</p>
<p><em>In choosing Deleuze over a more thoroughgoing engagement with the late Foucault, We have missed an opportunity to think about the scale and the category of the individual, as opposed to disbursed and diffuse network power and nonhuman agencies. (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3">note on p.499</a>)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"an “organic” development of Foucault’s work that could have helped us (and fortunately still can help us) negotiate the twin necessity for a theory more responsive to the total impact of media and for an account of subjectification that does not simply vacate the category of the individual." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3">Hansen 2012:499</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"the category of the individual." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3">Hansen 2012:499</a>)</span></p>
<p>"sway in an anonymous way (which is to say, beneath the level of personalization and subjecthood ), it nonetheless remains correlated with the body." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/5">Hansen 2012:501</a>)</p>
<p>"At the heart of this final quest is a nuanced meditation on individuation that addresses precisely those challenges posed by today’s “atmospheric media” without requiring the abandonment of the individual human perspective. As we shall see, Foucault’s final thinking on the individual involves a theorization of the larger process of individuation from which individuals emerge, and on this score his work parallels Deleuze’s and even more significantly Gilbert Simondon’s. Yet in contrast certainly to Deleuze and arguably to Simondon as well, Foucault places his emphasis squarely on grasping how the broader context of individuation impacts the experience of the individuals who, on his account, are the requisite correlates of any process of individuation." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/5">Hansen 2012:501</a>)</p>
<p>"Foucault is concerned with exploring how the maintenance of subindividual aggregates over time supports a reconceptualization of the category of the individual." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/6">Hansen 2012:502</a>)</p>
<p>"what might Simondon’s profoundly original rethinking of individuation as an open, multiscalar, and essentially incomplete process add to Foucault’s meditations on normativity, discipline, biopower, and governance?19" (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/6">Hansen 2012:502</a>)</p>
<p>"Individuation is an ongoing process that always occurs in conjunction with a “preindividual” domain, which Simondon defines as a “charge of nature attached to the individual.”21" (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/7">Hansen 2012:503</a>)</p>
<p><em>Relation as potentiality (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8">note on p.504</a>)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We cannot overemphasize this distinction: Simondon’s global situation differs from the autopoietic global perspective because it is not relative to the organism (that is, the organism plus its world) in isolation from the environment . Put otherwise, the global situation is not a perspective of the organism but a perspective on the individuation of the organism, that is, a perspective that situates the organism within the context of the preindivid ual.22 Central to this differentiation is Simondon’s insistence on the primacy of relationality over individuals related (or the equiprimacy of relation and individuation)" (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8">Hansen 2012:504</a>)</p>
<p>"The primacy Simondon accords relation thus serves to differentiate his conception of agency from Varela’s and all other accounts that focus solely on the domain of actuality. Whereas “embodied enaction” remains centered on the organism in an actualized coupling with a part of the environment (its world or surplus of significance), agency for Simondon encompasses the environment as a whole and as a source of potential that may or may not be actualized and, indeed, that need not be actual-" (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8">Hansen 2012:504</a>)</p>
<p>"ized by the organism in order to impact its individuation." (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/9">Hansen 2012:505</a>)</p></div>
