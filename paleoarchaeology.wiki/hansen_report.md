    Abstract

    This essay stages an encounter between Michel Foucault’s
    work—especially his final thought concerning biopolitics, security,
    and population—and contemporary theorization of media’s experiential
    impact. The essay argues that the opportunity for such an encounter
    has been obscured largely due to the role played by Gilles Deleuze
    (in particular by the concept of “control society”) in filtering
    Foucault’s work for media theory. The essay develops an approach to
    Foucault’s late work that centers on the population as a vehicle for
    rethinking individualization beyond substance; such an approach
    makes it possible to retain certain aspects of the category of the
    individual that are simply jettisoned in the contemporary embrace of
    Deleuze’s “dividual.” The essay concludes by exploring how this
    rethinking of Foucault’s work on individualization facilitates
    exploration of the impact of twenty-first-century “atmospheric”
    media on human individuation.

        "If today’s media can be distinguished from earlier media on
        account of their capacity to solicit our engagement beneath the
        threshold of attention, we can readily discern the challenges
        this shift poses to media theory. Nothing less is at stake here
        than the scale at which theory can operate:" ([Hansen
        2012:497](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/1))

        "Alternatively, we could invoke the pseudoHegelian Aufhebung to
        which Friedrich Kittler submitted Foucault’s archaeology: for
        Kittler and his fellow German media scientists, Foucault plays
        the role of steppingstone, setting into place the infrastructure
        for discourse networks that themselves demand grounding in
        concrete media systems.6 As was the case with Poster’s analysis
        of databases, the Foucault at issue in this media convergence is
        resolutely the Foucault of the 1970s. We might then ask why we
        haven’t seen a second round of engagement on the part of media
        theorists with Foucault’s later work, particularly given the
        affinity I begin here by citing." ([Hansen
        2012:498](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/2))

        *In choosing Deleuze over a more thoroughgoing engagement with
        the late Foucault, We have missed an opportunity to think about
        the scale and the category of the individual, as opposed to
        disbursed and diffuse network power and nonhuman agencies.
        ([note on p.499](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3))*

         

        "an “organic” development of Foucault’s work that could have
        helped us (and fortunately still can help us) negotiate the twin
        necessity for a theory more responsive to the total impact of
        media and for an account of subjectification that does not
        simply vacate the category of the individual." ([Hansen
        2012:499](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3))

        "the category of the individual." ([Hansen
        2012:499](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/3))

        "sway in an anonymous way (which is to say, beneath the level of
        personalization and subjecthood ), it nonetheless remains
        correlated with the body." ([Hansen
        2012:501](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/5))

        "At the heart of this final quest is a nuanced meditation on
        individuation that addresses precisely those challenges posed by
        today’s “atmospheric media” without requiring the abandonment of
        the individual human perspective. As we shall see, Foucault’s
        final thinking on the individual involves a theorization of the
        larger process of individuation from which individuals emerge,
        and on this score his work parallels Deleuze’s and even more
        significantly Gilbert Simondon’s. Yet in contrast certainly to
        Deleuze and arguably to Simondon as well, Foucault places his
        emphasis squarely on grasping how the broader context of
        individuation impacts the experience of the individuals who, on
        his account, are the requisite correlates of any process of
        individuation." ([Hansen
        2012:501](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/5))

        "Foucault is concerned with exploring how the maintenance of
        subindividual aggregates over time supports a
        reconceptualization of the category of the individual." ([Hansen
        2012:502](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/6))

        "what might Simondon’s profoundly original rethinking of
        individuation as an open, multiscalar, and essentially
        incomplete process add to Foucault’s meditations on normativity,
        discipline, biopower, and governance?19" ([Hansen
        2012:502](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/6))

        "Individuation is an ongoing process that always occurs in
        conjunction with a “preindividual” domain, which Simondon
        defines as a “charge of nature attached to the individual.”21"
        ([Hansen 2012:503](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/7))

        *Relation as potentiality ([note on
        p.504](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8))*

         

        "We cannot overemphasize this distinction: Simondon’s global
        situation differs from the autopoietic global perspective
        because it is not relative to the organism (that is, the
        organism plus its world) in isolation from the environment . Put
        otherwise, the global situation is not a perspective of the
        organism but a perspective on the individuation of the organism,
        that is, a perspective that situates the organism within the
        context of the preindivid ual.22 Central to this differentiation
        is Simondon’s insistence on the primacy of relationality over
        individuals related (or the equiprimacy of relation and
        individuation)" ([Hansen
        2012:504](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8))

        "The primacy Simondon accords relation thus serves to
        differentiate his conception of agency from Varela’s and all
        other accounts that focus solely on the domain of actuality.
        Whereas “embodied enaction” remains centered on the organism in
        an actualized coupling with a part of the environment (its world
        or surplus of significance), agency for Simondon encompasses the
        environment as a whole and as a source of potential that may or
        may not be actualized and, indeed, that need not be actual-"
        ([Hansen 2012:504](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/8))

        "ized by the organism in order to impact its individuation."
        ([Hansen 2012:505](zotero://open-pdf/0_UCSQ7G28/9))
