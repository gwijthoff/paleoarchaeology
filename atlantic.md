Do inanimate objects influence the course of human evolution?  Do those objects themselves evolve in anything more than a metaphorical sense?  A question that has long remained a subtext in evolutionary theory, the history of technology, and industrial design is now coming to the fore as the thin black slabs we carry around in our pockets, our own personal *2001: A Space Odyssey* monoliths, seem to be producing a noticeable drain, shift, modificaiton, amplification, amputation (depending on whose model you subscribe to) on our cognitive capacities.

This public account (of the internet making us stupider) has begun to be tempered recently -- see Clive Thompson's account of distributed memory. (Smarter Than You Think excerpt)

But it still holds sway in media theory circles…

But accounts of cognition and technology run deeper…

In the mid-1950s, a collection of Neanderthal artifacts was unearthed in the southwest of France, kicking off one of the most famous debates over the study of cultural transmission through the archaeological record.  These stone tools, a product of what we now call the Mousterian industry, included heart-shaped handaxes, knife edges with smoothed hand holds, a number of small flint borers, and ridge-faced scrapers described as “denticulate” for their tooth-like structure.

At a time before the development of chronometric techniques like radiocarbon dating that would allow later paleoarchaeologists to definitively order these artifacts in time and space, the Mousterian debate centered on the question of how we can extrapolate history from the formal properties of a technical object.

I focus on the two principal figures in the debate -- the established French archaeologist and sometime science fiction novelist Francois Bordes and the upstart American Lewis Binford, whose work inaugurated the New Archaeology movement of the 1960s -- in order to draw larger conclusions about how we both experience and interpret the objects around us.  Does a Neanderthal handaxe (or a telegraph key, or a touchscreen) provide evidence of a distinct culture that held shared traits (technology), or does it tell us about use and the network of actors and materials the tool may have come in contact with (technique)?

Despite their alien appearance and their improbable survival from a world so different from our own, these tools (like any other) almost seem to reach out and grasp us, whispering of how they are to be used.  The Mousterian industry and the paleoarchaeological debate surrounding it thus provides an object lesson in what we might call technology’s ontological magic:  how we come to understand what a tool is and what it’s good for.

Archaeological metaphors abound in media studies today: media archaeology, forensic imagination, etc.
